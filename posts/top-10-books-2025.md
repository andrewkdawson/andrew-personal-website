excerpt: "I got back into reading this year. Here are my favorite books that I read in 2025."

This was the year I really got back into reading. It started when I was at a friend's house and saw a shelf full of books I'd already read. I realized I was getting dumber—not because I'd stopped learning, but because I'd stopped the kind of deep, sustained thinking that comes from sitting with a book for hours.

So I made it a priority. I read on planes, between classes, late at night. And these are the books that stuck with me. This isn't a "best books" list—it's a list of the ones that made me feel something, think differently, or just couldn't put down.

## 10. Abaddon's Gate (The Expanse #3) / Caliban's War (The Expanse #2)

I read four books from *The Expanse* this year. This was my favorite.

## 9. Dark Age (Red Rising #5)

This book had a fitting title. Quite possibly the darkest book I've ever read. Ulysses part... what... Day of red doves was crazy. Wasn't super invested in the obsidian stuff but was locked in on everything else. End was really cool hype for light bringer.

## 8. Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman

So much fun.

## 7. Jade City by Fonda Lee

Really enjoyed this one. Worldbuilding, magic stuff, and characters were awesome. No one was particularly likable lol, but they were all really complex and interesting. Loved how it subverted my expectations, that one part really shocked me. Got pretty dark and messed up at times. Being a green bone would be cool if you didn't also have to be gang affiliated. Excited to continue the trilogy.

## 6. Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

So full circle. Loved it. Characters were kinda insufferable at the beginning, but by the end I liked them all. Expectations were constantly subverted. Philosophical, ridiculous, hilarious, emotional. So much depth to every character. Fredrik Backman is brilliant; excited to check out more of his stuff.

## 5. All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr

## 4. Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey

Loved this one start to finish. Had the audiobook too so I immersion read some of it, which was a lot of fun (since he reads it himself). Inspiring, hilarious, and beautifully written. Matthew McConaughey is a genius.

## 3. Dark Matter by Blake Crouch

Phenomenal read. Philosophical, entertaining, edge-of-your-seat type experience. It was kinda like an emotional episode of Rick and Morty. Wasn't just a multiverse story, it was about love, family, and perspective. Gonna have to try Recursion too.

## 2. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom

Had me tearing up on the plane. What an incredible read. Everyone should read this book. I'll be revisiting this often.

## 1. The Sword of Kaigen by M. L. Wang

Cried real tears.
